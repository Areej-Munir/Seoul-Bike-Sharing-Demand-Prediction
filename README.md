# Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
- Cleaned dataset using Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values and outliers.
- Visualized data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand distributions and relationships.
- Encoded categorical variables for modeling using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- Split data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- Applied feature scaling to standardize numerical features.
- Trained machine learning models, including Random Forest Regression.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and R^2.
- Visualized model predictions to understand trends and patterns.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest Regression using techniques like GridSearchCV.
- Imported Seaborn library for additional visualization capabilities.

This project showcases the use of data cleaning, visualization, encoding, model training, evaluation, and tuning techniques for predicting bike sharing demand in Seoul.
